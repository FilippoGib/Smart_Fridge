Food waste is a pressing global issue, with approximately 1.3 billion tons of food wasted annually, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This amounts to roughly one-third of all food produced for human consumption, while nearly 690 million people suffer from hunger worldwide. Food waste occurs at various stages, including production, retail, and consumption, with developed countries contributing significantly to household waste. The environmental impact is severe, as wasted food generates 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change. Addressing this issue requires systemic changes, including improved supply chain efficiency, consumer awareness, and policy interventions to reduce waste and ensure food security.
